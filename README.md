# 🛒 E-Commerce Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **customer segmentation in an e-commerce environment using pure unsupervised machine learning techniques**.

Unlike supervised learning, no labeled data is used. Instead, customers are grouped based on behavioral patterns to discover meaningful segments that can help businesses understand their customers better.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
E-commerce platforms collect large amounts of customer data but often lack explicit labels for customer behavior.  
The challenge is to uncover hidden patterns and group similar customers without predefined categories.

This project solves the problem using **unsupervised learning algorithms** to perform customer segmentation.
